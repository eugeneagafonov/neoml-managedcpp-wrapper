# neoml-managedcpp-wrapper
Managed C++ wrapper for ABBYY NeoML library

To build the C++ wrapper project you need to have C++ support enabled in Visual Studio, and you need to build NeoMLProxy and set the environment variable NEOMLPROXY_INSTALL_FOLDER to point to a folder where make install output for NeoMLProxy is located (e.g. D:/Repos/neoml-lib/installproxy).

NeoML is available here: [NeoML](https://github.com/neoml-lib/neoml)
